About
========
The code package was designed and written by me (Kenza Samlali), based on the ArduBridge package designed by Guy Soffer, which can be found here: 

This software is complementary to the use with a hybrid microfluidic device for trapping, encapsulating single-cells and performing various deterministic operations with single-cell containing droplets.

More information on the use of this software, how to set up a hybrid microfluidic system, how to fabricate the device and how to use the device, can be found in our publication here: 
   

We are encouraging users of this code to improve on it or develop additional modules.  
When developing additional modules to Guy Soffer's ArduBridge, please appropriately cite their work and refer to their repository, if so. 
When building on top of the syringe pump integration code or GUI, please appropriately cite this work and refer to this repository, if so. 

This work was done as part of my Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Steve Shih, at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Center of Applied Synthetic Biology, Concordia University.
