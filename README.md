Overview
========
<p>The code package was designed and written by me (Kenza Samlali), based on the ArduBridge package designed by Guy Soffer, which can be found here: </p>

This software is complementary to the use with a hybrid microfluidic device for trapping, encapsulating single-cells and performing varioous deterministic operations with single-cell containing droplets. <br>
More information on the use of this software (hardware and biology), can be found in our publication here: <br>
We are encouraging users of this code to improve on it or develop additional modules. Please appropriately cite the paper mentioned above or refer to this repository, if so. <br>
This work was done as part of my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Steve Shih, at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Center of Applied Synthetic Biology, Concordia University.
